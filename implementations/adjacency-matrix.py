"""The easiest way to represent a graph is via an adjacency matrix. In this representation,
each dimension represents a vertex in the graph, and A[i,j] = edge weight from i -> j.

A primary problem with such a representation is sparsity. In this sense, the implementation is
more ideal when the number of edges is large (ie the graph is more heavily connected)."""
